## Overview

The goal for this workshop 

We will work upwards from the basics of profiling and benchmarking. 


The general theme is to start from the smallest pieces, profiling a small piece of code, the write a benchmark to quantify the changes, take a small detour into escape analysis, inlining, as they are related to microbenchmarking. Then step out and talk about the execution tracer, including tracing running applications. The last two sections are really a grab back of advice, and tips.
